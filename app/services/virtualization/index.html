<p>Virtualization addresses IT’s most pressing challenge: the infrastructure sprawl that compels IT departments to channel 70 percent of their budget into maintenance, leaving scant resources for business-building innovation.
The difficulty stems from the architecture of today’s X86 computers: they’re designed to run just one operating system and application at a time. As a result, even small data centers have to deploy many servers, each operating at just five percent to 15 percent of capacity—highly inefficient by any standard.
Virtualization software solves the problem by enabling several operating systems and applications to run on one physical server or “host.” Each self-contained “virtual machine” is isolated from the others, and uses as much of the host’s computing resources as it requires.</p>
